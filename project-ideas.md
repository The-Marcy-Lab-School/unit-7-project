# Project Ideas

For this project, you are expected to have three database tables as part of your Minimum Viable Product. In addition, you must have at least one Many-to-Many relationship in your application. The main purpose of this project is to practice buiding out a CRUD Express App. You must have at least CREATE and READ funcitonality for all tables, and you must have full CRUD for at least one table.

It is perfectly acceptable (and even encouraged) to build a clone of an existing application. Below are a list of project ideas, all of which involve _at least_ three tables and _at least_ one many-to-many relationship.

## Solo Project Ideas

If you are completing a Unit 7 Project as a soloist, you are expected to have two database tables as part of your MVP. The relationship between your tables must be a One-to-Many. 

There any many simple app ideas that would fit nicely into these requirements. For example, a Personal To Do List would have a `Users` table and a `ToDos` table. A user would be able to create an account, sign in, and keep track of their ToDos. However, so many bootcamp students build a basic To Do List as part of their portfolio. 

For your project, we want you to build some other personal website or personal tracker! All of the ideas below involve _at least_ two tables and _at least_ one one-to-many relationship and are acceptable project ideas! You must have full CRUD for your non-user table. You must have CREATE and READ functionality on your `Users` table.
