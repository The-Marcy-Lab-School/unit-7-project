# Unit 7 Project: Build a Full-Stack Application!

## Directions
Congratulations! You can use the DOM API to create dynamic user interfaces. You can use AJAX to make asynchronous requests from your browser to third party APIs. Now, you can program business logic on the server side and persist data to a relational database. You have brought the two together to design RESTful APIs. You are now a full-stack developer! It's time to bring all of the pieces together for your first full-stack application.

As always, there are general guidelines and checkpoints for this project, but it is left open-ended so that you can let your passion and interests drive your creativity. The purpose of this project is for you to:
  1. Practice domain modeling and RESTful API design in an applied context.
  2. Gain practice building clean, intuitive UIs that speak to REST APIs that you designed.
  3. Build a minimimum viable product that could grow to impact the lives of real people.

## Project Requirements
* You must build a fullstack application with Express and your app must be connected to a Postgres Database. 
* The backend portion of your app should be a RESTful API that facilitates CRUD operations on a Postgres database. 
* The frontend portion of your app should be an HTML/JS UI, much like your Unit 6 Project. 
* You should have at two entities/tables in your Postgres Database and at least two One-To-Many relationships. 
* Additionally, it is highly encouraged that your project should include some form of user authorization.

## Using Your Resources
Just like last time, this project will push you to lean into your _autodidacticism_. In order to complete this project at a satisfactory level, you _will_ have to do some self-learning. This is by design. By pulling from blog articles, YouTube tutorials, and examples on GitHub, you will be able to build whatever you put your mind to.

## Grading
### Scoring
Your submission will be scored against the following criteria:

#### Domain Model:
* Are the key entities that power your project clearly defined and housed in distinct tables in your database?
* Are the relationships between entities properly represented in your database?

#### RESTful Design:
* Are CRUD operations correctly mapped to the appropriate HTTP methods?
* Are routes intuitively named?

#### User Interface/Experience:
* Is your app visually appealing?
* Can it be used intuitively with minimal direction?
* Is the frontend bug free?

#### Code Quality:
* Is your business logic well-encapsulated?
* Is your code clearly organized according to models, routes, and controllers?
* Are your variables and functions well-named?
* Is your code well commented?
