# GitHub Workflow

1. Your project lead will create the cannonical GitHub repo.
2. Project lead will add other member as collaborator.
3. Clone the repo locally.
4. To make changes, you'll check out a new branch. `git checkout -b users`
5. Commit often. Commit messages are important so that you can revert to previous commits if need be.
6. You'll push up to your branch and create a remote copy of that branch. 
  `git push -u origin users`
7. When feature comes to completion, you'll open up a PR and notify your partner for a code review.
8. Once your partner approves, then _they_ will merge your PR.
